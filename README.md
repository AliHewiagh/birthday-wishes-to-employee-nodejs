# Realm Digital Simple Practical Assessment

## Birthday-Wishes-To-Employee


## Tasks
Design and implement a service component that will send birthday wishes to employees.

The service must extract a list of employees whose birthdays occur today using the Realm Digital Employee API
and create a generic message E.g. ‚ÄúHappy Birthday {name 1}, {name 2}‚Äù and send the message to an email
address configured for the component | ‚úî 


The following needs to be considered:
* Leap year | ‚úî 
* Employee exclusions. An exclusion can be any of the following: 
  * The employee no longer works for Realm Digital | ‚úî 
  * The employee has not started working for Realm Digital | ‚úî 
  * Or the employee has been specifically configured to not receive birthday wishes | ‚úî 


The component must support being executed at most once for a specific employee‚Äôs birthday wish, regardless of
how many times the service is scheduled to run on a specific day | ‚úñÔ∏è

Architecturally, the solution must be designed to support additional messaging functionality such as sending work
anniversary messages.| ‚úî

Note: The work anniversary requirement does not need to be coded but the solution design should cater for the
additional requirement
